This is a website containing two FREE poker tools to improve your flop game. 

# Range Breakdown
The first tool analyzes the flop using two optimal preflop ranges and returns the connectivity of the flop to each range, answering questions such as who has the range advantage, nut advantage, and so on. This tool can be used to determine how aggressive you can act on the flop, and more advanced users can use this data to punish mistakes such as over-cbetting or overfolding, two common tendencies in the low-mid stakes.

# Hand VS Range
This tool allows you to get the equity of one hand versus an optimal range given any flop. You can use this tool to determine whether you have the equity to call a bet given an opponent is betting close to, if not their entire range. More specifically, this tool can be utilized to construct defenses for the 1/3 pot c-bet with range strategy, a move that many opponents use but don't study proper defenses for. 

For more questions, check out the FAQ page on the website. It is free to sign up!
